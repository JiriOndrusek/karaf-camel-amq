= Camel AMQ QuickStart

This quickstart demonstrates how to connect to AMQ Online and use JMS messaging between two Camel routes.

IMPORTANT: The version of AMQ Online has to be at least 1.2

In this example we will use two containers, one container to run as an AMQ Online instance, and another as a client to the broker, where the Camel routes are running.

This quickstart requires AMQ Online to have been deployed and running first. To install AMQ Online into OpenShift or Kubernetes follow https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.4/html/installing_and_managing_amq_online_on_openshift_container_platform/installing-messaging[documentation].
